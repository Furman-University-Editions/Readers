# Let’s Read Ancient Languages!

Reading Greek may or may not be a spectator sport, but we will never know unless we try.

Below are some links to videos in which students of ancient languages, at various stages in their studies, come together to read texts.

## Plutarch, *Alexander*

Gregory Crane and Christopher Blackwell read through and discuss certain passages of Plutarch’s *Life of Alexander*.

To follow along [Plutarch, *Alexander*, 1 ](Plutarch/Plut_Alex_1_5.html), and [57](Plutarch/Plut_Alex_56–60.html) We begin reading Plutarch’s *Life of Alexander* from the Greek text, the author’s introduction, and then skipping to where Alexander the Great is about to cross the mountains into India. You can also use the lovely [Scaife Viewer](https://scaife.perseus.org) to read this text in Greek and English.
