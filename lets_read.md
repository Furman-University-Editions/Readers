# Let’s Read Ancient Languages!

Reading Greek may or may not be a spectator sport, but we will never know unless we try.

To follow along [Plutarch, *Alexander*, 1 ](Plutarch/Plut_Alex_1_5.html), and [57](Plutarch/Plut_Alex_56–60.html) We begin reading Plutarch’s *Life of Alexander* from the Greek text, the author’s introduction, and then skipping to where Alexander the Great is about to cross the mountains into India.
